This session shows how to re-use the information in the data- and process models in SQL Developer to power our APEX applications.
SQLDeveloper model information can be exported into a reporting database schema. This information can then be providing input to the wizard generation of APEX pages, it can control navigation, provide help texts, domains and much more.
The session demoâ€™s several examples of how this technique was used in a large Danish APEX project. It will also demo how easy it is to create data and process models in SQLDeveloper and how Javascript can be used to easily extend our models, to generate code.
